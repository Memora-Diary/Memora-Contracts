### Core Functions

#### NFT Management

- **Minting NFTs**: Users can mint NFTs with custom URIs and assign a judge, heir, and action for account management.
- **Inheritance Mechanism**: After a judge declares a "trigger" and a buffer period passes, the heir can inherit the NFT or perform actions like managing accounts, closing accounts, or transferring funds.
- **Buffer Period**: A configurable time period that must pass after the judge triggers the inheritance process before the heir can act.
- **Account Actions**:
  - **Manage Account**: Transfer the NFT to the heir after trigger declaration.
  - **Close Account**: Burns the NFT when the trigger is declared and the heir signs.
  - **Transfer Funds**: The NFT's balance is transferred to the heir.
- **Funding the NFTs**: Owners and other users can add BTC to an NFT, which will be inherited by the designated heir.
- **Heir Signing**: Heirs need to sign after the buffer period to inherit the NFT or the funds associated with it.

## Contract Details

- **Name**: `MemoraNFTV2`
- **Token Standard**: ERC721
- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.20
- **License**: MIT

## Events

- **JudgeDeclaredTriggered**: Emitted when the judge declares a trigger.
- **HeirSigned**: Emitted when the heir signs after the buffer period.
- **NFTInherited**: Emitted when the NFT is successfully transferred to the heir.
- **TriggerDisabled**: Emitted when the trigger is disabled by the owner.
- **BufferChanged**: Emitted when the buffer period is modified.
- **NFTInheritedAndFundsReleased**: Emitted when funds are transferred to the heir along with the NFT.
- **FundsAdded**: Emitted when funds are added to the NFT's balance.

## Functions

### Minting and Management

- `mint(address heir, uint256 choice, string memory prompt, string memory tokenURI, uint256 farcasterID)`: Mints a new NFT.
- `declareTrigger(uint256 tokenId)`: The judge declares that a trigger event has occurred.
- `heirSign(uint256 tokenId)`: The heir signs and inherits the NFT or funds after the buffer period.
- `disableTrigger(uint256 tokenId)`: The NFT owner can disable a trigger.
- `changeBuffer(uint256 _buffer_period)`: Only the owner can change the buffer period for the contract.

### Fund Management

- `addFunds(uint256 tokenId)`: Adds Ether to an NFT, which can be inherited by the heir.
- `getTokenBalance(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the balance of a given NFT.
- `withdrawFunds(uint256 tokenId)`: Allows the token owner to withdraw funds associated with the token.
